## Design

### Colour
The site's colour scheme consists of five key colours; White, black, yellow, teal and light-blue. White is used for buttons and input fields. Black is used for text and icons. Yellow is used for the background and the Quick Guide text-boxes. Light-blue is used for clicked buttons.

### Font

One font was used on the site; Signika Negative, which is a clear and legible font.

### Structure

The website structure consists of a main page and 404 page. The main page has a persistent media control section at the top of the page and a section below consisting of three windows. Only one window is visible at a time and can be changed using tabs at the top of this section. 

The sections and windows are detailed below;

<details><summary>Media Control</summary>

## Features

The website consists of six sections with thirteen features.

### Media Controls
- Situated in a persistent position at the top of the page.
- Contains the playback button, tempo control and kit selection.
- The playback button can be clicked to Play or Stop the loop playback.
- The Tempo control consists of a number input and refresh button. The number input changes the tempo value, which is in beats per minute. The tempo can then be updated by clicking the refresh button. The tempo value is limited between 60 and 200. A tooltip shows this range when entering a value and when clicking refresh, the tooltip shows that the tempo has been updated.
- The Kit selection area consists of a dropdown with 4 options. These 4 options change the drum sounds on each of the drum sequencer tracks. Selecting an option immediately updates the sounds.
- Meets user stories: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9.

### Tab Navigation
- Situated below the Media Control.
- Contains three tabs for each of the three windows.
- When clicked the tabs change the window.
- The first tab (Sequencer), shows the sequencer window.
- The second tab (Presets/Share), shows the presets and share window.
- The third tab (Information), shows the information window.
- When a tab is clicked, the other tab's background colours change to a darker colour. This is to show that the tab's window is not active. Only in-active tabs will change the window, clicking an active tab has no effect.

### Sequencer
- Situated below the Tab Navigation section, connected to the first tab.
- Contains six drum tracks
- Each of the six tracks consists of a Drum Pad, Mute button, Clear button and a 16 Step Sequencer.
- The Drum pad plays an audio sample of the track's sound when clicked. The pad's colour changes temporarily when clicked to give visual feedback to the user, informing them that the button was clicked.
- The Mute button will mute the track and stop the track's audio from playing during playback. The button's colour changes to visually inform the user that the mute button is active.
- The clear button toggles off any active steps in the track's step sequencer. The button's colour changes temporarily to provide visual feedback to the user that the change has occurred.
- The 16 Step Sequencers consists of 16 buttons. When a button is clicked the colour changes to provide visual feedback that the step is active. During playback, when the playback position reaches the step's position, if the step is active the track's sound will trigger.
- Each track's step has a different colour. This is to clearly show the different tracks and also to provide variety to the visuals.
- Meets user stories: 1, 2, 7, 8.

### Preset/Share Section
- Situated below the Tab Navigation section, connected to the second tab.
- Contains three sub-sections; Preset Loops, Sharing Loops and Submit for Review.
- The Preset Loops sub-section consists of a Heading, paragraph with short instructions, a dropdown and a refresh button. The dropdown contains a list of pre-made Loops, the user can select a loop then click the refresh button to load the loop into the Sequencer. The window will then automatically change to the sequencer window, populate the sequencer and the media control. This change provides visual feedback to the user that the change has occurred.
- The Sharing Loops sub-sections consists of a Heading, paragraph with instructions, a text input-box, a button to Export Loop and a button to Import Loop. When clicking the Export Loop button, the text input-box is populated with a Loop Data text string which has been compiled using Javascript. The user can then copy this text and share it with other users. The other users can then paste the Loop Data in the text input-box on their session of the site and click the Import Button. The Loop Data will then be decompiled and loaded to the sequencer. Both buttons when clicked, temporarily chance colour to visually notify the user that it has been clicked.
- The Submit for Review sub-section consists of a Heading and a button. The button when clicked, opens up a Submission Window. This window is detailed further in the section below.
- Meets user stories: 4, 5.

### Submission Window
- This window displays after clicking the "Submit Loop for Review" button on the Preset/Share window.
- Consists of a close button, a section containing a Heading and paragraph with instructions, and a section containing a form with a button, and an alert text box.
- The close button when clicked hides the submission window.
- The form consists of three text input fields and a button. The text inputs are for; Name, Email Address, and Your Loop Title. The button when clicked will submit the form.
- The form contains validation and will not submit if any of the fields are empty, and if the email address is not a valid email. The alert textbox will show below the button after clicking.
- The button can display four different messages;
1."Please enter details in all three text boxes"
2."Please enter a valid Email Address"
3."Please wait, sending details..."
4."Loop Data successfully sent for review!"
- Messages 1 and 2 display when trying to submit invalid inputs. Messages 3 and 4 display when submitting valid inputs.
- When submitting the form also submits the exported Loop Data.
- All form data is submitted through EmailJS and an email is sent to the site owner. This is detailed further in a section below.
- Meets user stories: 11.

### EmailJS
- [EmailJS](https://dashboard.emailjs.com) is utilised to supply the site owner with user submitted Loops via email.
- After the Submission Form is completed and submitted by the user, the data is collated into a email using an email template on emailJS. This email is then sent the the site owner's email address.
- Below are screenshots of the template and an example email;

<img src="docs/validation/website_css_warning_validation.JPG">
</details>

### JS Validation

JSHint was utilised to validate the website's JS. The three scripts received the following results;

- drums.js received 4 warnings is relation to "Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics." The code is functioning correctly, so I have chosen not to make any changes to the 4 sections referenced. Three undefined variables are referenced; "AudioContext", this is used for the Web Audio API. "stepInterval", this is assigned to the SetInterval function so the interval can be cleared when the track is stopped or the tempo is updated. "ShowDrumWindow", this is a function in navigation.js which is loaded earlier in index.html.
<details><summary>drums.js</summary>
<img src="docs/validation/drums_js_validation.JPG">
</details>

- navigation.js received 0 warnings.
<details><summary>navigation.js</summary>
<img src="docs/validation/navigation_js_validation.JPG">
</details>

- form.js received 0 warnings. Two undefined variables were referenced; "ExportLoop", this is a function in drum.js which is loaded earlier in index.html, and "emailjs", this is used for EmailJS. One unused variable was referenced (SendLoop), this loop is not called in the script but is called via an onclick event in index.html.

11. I would like the website to have a loop submission form with validation implemented so the form cannot be submitted blank or with invalid values.

| **Feature**                          | **Action Required**                                                                      | **Expected Outcome**                                       | **Actual Outcome**|
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Form Validation                      | Invalid or Empty form inputs will not submit and display alert. Only valid data submits  | Website functions correctly on different devices           | Works as expected |
